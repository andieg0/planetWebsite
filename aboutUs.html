    <div class="container">
        We are a group of three girls from different universities across the UK who are passionate about coding. We know that the job market is changing very fast, and we need to stay competitive and continue developing ourselves and learning new skills.
This introductory course in Web Development helps us do that. This website is our final project to demonstrate what we have learned so far. We used HTML to build web pages, a CSS file to style them, Bootstrap CSS to make a carousel, basic user interaction with JavaScript, and applied UI/UX rules.
We worked together in the hopes you'll enjoy our website while learning about the solar system.
